Notepad++ smali syntax highlighting for Dark Mode

## Installation:
1. Open Notepad++ and go into the "Languages" tab
2. Inside "User Defined Language" choose "Define your Language"
3. Choose "Import" and select the downloaded .xml from this repo (found in [Releases](https://github.com/hiyall360/Notepad-darkmode-smali/releases/tag/release)).
4. Restart Notepad++ (If changes don't appear right away, make sure to choose "Smali-Dark" from the "Languages" tab

### Notes:

For obvious reasons, make sure your Notepad++ is set to Dark Mode, and the style is set to "DarkModeDefault" though it'll work for most dark styles.
